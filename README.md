## Solution Overview

The Automations for AWS Firewall Manager solution is intended for customers looking to easily manage consistent security posture across their entire AWS Organization. The solution uses AWS Firewall Manager Service.

By deploying the Prerequisite stack, you can easily install all requirements needed to fulfill Firewall Manager service prerequisites, so that you can focus on your organization's security posture.

With the release of v2.1.0, AWS Shield Advanced customers have the option to deploy additional CloudFormation templates to automatically setup [health-based detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-advanced-health-checks.html) and [proactive engagement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-srt-proactive-engagement.html) across their organization in 1-click. This solution does not automatically subscribe to Shield Advanced for you.


## Architecture

The default deployment of solution pre-packaged template deploys following infrastructure in your account. The architecture can be grouped into two separate workflows: **Policy manager** and **Compliance report generator**.

<img src="architecture.pdf" width="600" height="350">

**Policy Manager**: The component is responsible for CRUD operations on the Firewall Manager security policies.

**Compliance Report Generator**: The component is responsible for generating compliance reports on your Firewall Manager security policies, in csv format.

## Architecture with Automations for AWS Shield Advanced (Optional)

If you are an AWS Shield Advanced subscriber and choose to deploy the `aws-fms-shield-automations` CloudFormation template, the following resources will be automatically created in your deployment account.

<img src="./shield-architecture.png" width="600" height="338">

**Policy Manager**: Deployed by the Primary solution stack. This component is responsible for CRUD operations on the Firewall Manager security policies.

**Automated Health-based Detection**: Deployed by the Shield Automations stack. Resources include two Lambda functions (`ConfigRuleEval`, `ConfigRuleRemediate`), an SQS Queue, and an Organizational Config Rule. These components do the following:
- ConfigRuleEval: This Lambda function is triggered by the Organizational Config Rule and handles custom evaluation of resources by validating the AWS Shield Advanced Protection and determining whether it has Route 53 Health Checks associated with it.
- ConfigRuleRemediate: This Lambda function reads messages published to the SQS Queue by `ConfigRuleEval` and creates Route 53 Health Checks, then associates them with Shield Advanced Protections.
- SQS Queue: Queue for holding messages to trigger remediation of Shield Advanced Protections.
- Organizational Config Rule: Captures existing AWS Shield Advanced Protections in the AWS Organization and evaluates their compliance using the `ConfigRuleEval` Lambda function.

### Custom Policy Stack

There may be situations where you want to manage multiple Firewall Manager policy configurations. Let's say you want to apply policy configuration A to Organizational Units A1,A2,A3 in Region R1 and you want to apply policy configuration B to Organizational Units B1,B2,B3 in Region R2. To achieve this you may use nested [policy template](https://solutions-reference.s3.amazonaws.com/automations-for-aws-firewall-manager/latest/aws-fms-policy.template) packaged with the solution.

- Step 1: deploy the [primary template](https://solutions-reference.s3.amazonaws.com/automations-for-aws-firewall-manager/latest/aws-fms-automations.template)
- Step 2: deploy the [policy template](https://solutions-reference.s3.amazonaws.com/automations-for-aws-firewall-manager/latest/aws-fms-policy.template) as many times as per the permutation and combination of Policy configuration, Organization Units and AWS Regions where you want to create the policies.
- Step 3: update the default policy_manifest.json file that gets staged in the `PolicyManifest` S3 bucket created with stack deployment from Step 2. Once you upload the modified policy_manifest.json file into the `PolicyManifest` S3 bucket, the associated Firewall Manager policies will be automatically updated.

The policy template requires following parameters:

- Policy Identifier: A unique string identifier for the policies, eg. ProductionPolicy

_Value for other parameters **Policy Table**, **Metric Queue** and **UUID** can be found out from output section of primary FMS automations stack_

For more details on custom policy template, read here in the [implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/automations-for-aws-firewall-manager/customize-policies.html)

## Customization

- Prerequisite: Node.js=18

### Setup

Clone the repository and run the following commands to install dependencies, format and lint as per the project standards

```
npm i
npm run prettier-format
npm run lint
```

### Changes

You may make any needed change in the source code as per your requirement. (E.g. [Sample Scenario](#sample-scenario))

You can customize the code and add any extensibility to the solution. Please review our [feature request guidelines](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), if you want to submit a PR.

### Unit Test

You can run unit tests with the following command from the root of the project

```
 npm run test
```

### Build

You can build lambda binaries with the following command from the root of the project

```
 npm run build
```

### Deploy

AWS Solutions use two buckets: a bucket for global access to templates, which is accessed via HTTPS, and regional
buckets for access to assets within the region, such as Lambda code. You will need:

- One global bucket that is accessed via the http end point. AWS CloudFormation templates are stored here. It must end
  with "-reference. Ex. "mybucket-reference"
- One regional bucket for each region where you plan to deploy using the name of the global bucket as the root, and
  suffixed with the region name. Ex. "mybucket-us-east-1"
- Your buckets should be encrypted and disallow public access

**Note**: When creating your buckets, ensure they are not publicly accessible. Use random bucket names. Disable public
access. Use KMS encryption. And verify bucket ownership before uploading.

#### Build the solution

First ensure that you've run `npm install` in the _source_ folder.

Next from the _deployment_ folder in your cloned repo, run build-s3-dist.sh, passing the root name of your bucket (ex.
mybucket) and the version you are building (ex. v1.0.0). We recommend using a semver version based on the version
downloaded from GitHub (ex. GitHub: v1.0.0, your build: v1.0.0.mybuild)

```bash
chmod +x build-s3-dist.sh
build-s3-dist.sh -b <bucketname> -v <version>
```

#### Run Unit Tests

Run and confirm that all unit tests pass.

```bash
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

### Upload to your buckets

**Note**: Verify bucket ownership before uploading.

From the _deployment_ folder, run upload-s3-dist.sh, passing the region (e.g. `us-east-1`) where you would like to deploy the solution.
```bash
chmod +x upload-s3-dist.sh
upload-s3-dist.sh <region>
```

### Deploy

See the [Automations for AWS Firewall Manager Implementation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/automations-for-aws-firewall-manager/solution-overview.html) for
deployment instructions, using the S3 link to the template in your bucket, rather than the one for AWS Solutions. Ex.https://mybucket-reference.s3.amazonaws.com/automations-for-aws-firewall-manager/v2.1.0.mybuild/aws-fms-automations.template

### Sample Scenario

The default deployment uses opinionated values as setup in [policy manifest file](./source/resources/lib/policy_manifest.json). In this scenario let's say we want to update the global WAF policies default and turn-off the auto-remediation behavior. We can make the change as seen below and turn **remediationEnabled** to _false_.

```
 "policyName": "FMS-WAF-01",
 "policyScope": "Global",
 "resourceType": "AWS::CloudFront::Distribution",
 "remediationEnabled": false,
```

After making needed changes in the policy manifest, we need to update [policy stack](source/resources/lib/nestedStacks/policy.stack.ts) so that the solution uses our customized local copy of policy manifest. For this, you can un-comment the following snippet in policy.stack.ts; And comment-out/remove the AWSCustomResource('CopyManifest') code block that downloads policy manifest from aws-solutions S3 bucket.

```
new BucketDeployment(this, "CopyManifest", {
  sources: [
    Source.asset(`${path.dirname(__dirname)}/lib`, {
      exclude: ["**", "!policy_manifest.json"],
    }),
  ],
  destinationBucket: policyBucket,
  prune: true,
});

```

Additionally, if you want to control sending solution usage metrics to aws-solutions, you can refer to [solution manifest file](./source/resources/lib/solution_manifest.json).

```
"solutionVersion": "%%VERSION%%", #provide a valid value eg. v1.0
"sendMetric": "Yes",
```
